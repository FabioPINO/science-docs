# A gallery of numerical failures

Since quite some time I've been willing to create a *gallery of numerical failures* that would collect pictures in which a certain numerical method failed, with an explanation of what happened. I believe that it can be useful to raise awareness of things that can go wrong using a certain method. And fun to watch too! Hopefully, I'll find time to get around to doing it at some point :)

For the moment, enjoy the possible way in which Euler method can fail if you just happened to select your delta x equal to half the period of a trigonometric function! (Somehow, this plot always reminds me of the scene from the movie Toy Story 2 where the game version of Buzz Lightyear jumps over circular platforms to the music of *Also sprach Zarathustra*.)
