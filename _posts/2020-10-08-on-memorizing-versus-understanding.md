# On memorizing versus understanding

I've been wondering a lot lately what is the difference between memorizing something versus understanding something. In this post I ask a lot of questions to which I don't know the answers.

Say someone comes up to you today with a mathematical proof written on a piece of paper and tells you that tomorrow he'll show up again and you'd have to recite that proof to him straight from your head. You have two choices: (1) you memorize everything ("word-to-word") that is written on that piece of paper, (2) you understand that proof and you recite it by "figuring it out as you go" (with some small memorization used to remember how things are denoted or called).

Certainly we've all experienced the feeling of having understood something. It's that "click" or "aha" moment associated with a pleasant sensation, perhaps even a sensation of relief. And perhaps some people would call the first option of memorizing word-to-word as the "dumb" way. But then, what is that feeling in your head after you've understood something? And how is that neurologically different from having memorized something?

You can test your own feeling of having understood something on an example of a mathematical proof:

> A set **A** that contains all sets that don't contain themselves as their members cannot exist.

A way to prove it, is to show that we arrive at a contradiction in two excluding cases: assuming that **A** contains itself as its member and assuming that **A** does not contains itself as its member. Here's the full proof:

That's a reasoning that requires certain time and processing in your head before you "get convinced" that it is reasonable. You could memorize everything that I've written there and to the outside world there would be no difference. There is a difference in your brain however that only you know about.

Is understanding a different form of memory that is more compressed? Is the pleasant feeling associated with understanding something our brain's way of rewarding us for compressing information?
