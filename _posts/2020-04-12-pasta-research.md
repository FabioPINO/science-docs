# Pasta research

One of my research interests include studying mechanical and thermo-physical properties of pasta. This research was initiated with my long-time Italian partner [Stefano Boccelli](http://boccelliengineering.altervista.org/). After an experimental campaign to determine the Young modulus of spaghetti, our direction shifted towards studying pasta in a more squishy state. In particular, we have studied the elongation of a spaghetto as well as changes in electrical resistance with the time of cooking.

Please contact us if you would like to collaborate on any of these research topics.

Here are some results from our previous research efforts:
