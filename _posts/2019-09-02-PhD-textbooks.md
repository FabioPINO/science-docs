# Literature review from textbooks

Short infos on textbooks that I'm reading during my PhD. Review on important information that can be found in them. Subjective judgements of the textbooks.

## `M. W. Hirsch, S. Smale, R. L. Devaney - Differential equations, dynamical systems and introduction to chaos`

| Pages | 400 |
| Math amount | Lot, easy (linear algebra mostly) |
| PhD utility | High |
| Insight | High |
| Personal profit | High |



## `P. Holmes, J. L. Lumley, G. Berkooz, C. W. Rowley - Turbulence, Coherent Structures, Dynamical Systems and Symmetry`

| Pages | 400 |
| Math amount | Some, advanced |
| PhD utility | High |
| Insight | High |
| Personal profit | High |
