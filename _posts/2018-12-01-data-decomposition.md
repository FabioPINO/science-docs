# Data decomposition

I really enjoy learning from data decomposition. I can appreciate this process in a philosophical sense as well. Isn't it like finding ghosts hidden behind our reality? But real ghosts. Ghosts that are really there and we really don't have access to them from our dimension. We can only find them mathematically. They show up in pictures when we decompose snapshots.

From their perspective, we live in this high-dimensional, correlated world with non-orthogonal basis. And there exists an adjoint world, which is more efficiently described, only that we got used to making sense of the variables describing our world and the parameters from this other world doesn't always make sense to us.
