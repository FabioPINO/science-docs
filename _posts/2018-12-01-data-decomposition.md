# Data decomposition

I really enjoy learning from data decomposition. I can appreciate this process in a philosophical sense. Isn't it like finding ghosts hidden behind our reality? But real ghosts. Ghosts that are really there and we really don't have access to them from our dimension. We can only find them mathematically. They show up in pictures when we decompose snapshots.

From their perspective, we live in this high-dimensional, correlated world with a non-orthogonal basis. And there exists their adjoint world, transformed from ours, which is more efficiently described. We got used to making sense of the variables describing our world and the parameters from this other world doesn't always make sense to us.
