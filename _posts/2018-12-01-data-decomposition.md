# Data decomposition

I can appreciate the process of data decomposition in a philosophical sense. Isn't it like finding ghosts hidden behind our reality? But real ghosts. Ghosts that are really there and we really don't have access to them from our *dimension*. We can only find them mathematically. And like good old movie ghosts, suddenly they show up in a picture after you've decomposed a snapshot of data.

From their perspective, we live in this high-dimensional, highly correlated world with a non-orthogonal basis. And there exists their adjoint world, transformed from ours, which is more efficiently described. But we got used to making sense of the variables describing our world and the parameters from this other world don't always make sense to us.
