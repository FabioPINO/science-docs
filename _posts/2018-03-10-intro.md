# Welcome to Science Docs!

Hello explorer and experimenter, welcome to **Science Docs**! Or as Python would say:

{% highlight python %}
print("Howdy, Universe!")
{% endhighlight %}

**Science Docs** is a small site with beatiful PDFs that are the product of most of my passion that I have for life, universe and everything else. I hope that the PDFs will enrich your journey through learning science and engineering.

## About me

Hi, I'm Kamila. I am currently working as a PhD researcher in the field of combustion and fluid dynamics.

I enjoy inventing my own ways of explaining difficult things and Science Docs is pretty much an aftermath of that.

If you wish to contact me via mail, feel free to drop me a line at: `kamilazdybal@gmail.com`
