# Hello explorer and experimenter, welcome to **Science Docs**!

Or as Python would say:

{% highlight python %}
print("Howdy, Universe!")
{% endhighlight %}

**Science Docs** is a small site with beautiful PDFs that are the product of most of my passion that I have for life, Universe and everything else. I hope that the PDFs will enrich your journey through learning and discovery.

## About me

Hi, I'm Kamila. I am currently working as a PhD researcher in the field of combustion and fluid dynamics.

I enjoy inventing my own ways of explaining difficult things and Science Docs is pretty much an aftermath of that. I believe in the quote of Einstein: *you do not really understand something unless you can explain it to your grandmother*, combined with the recent studies on how the human brain learns most effectively. My aim is to implement that level of understanding into the documents I write. I am also a strong supporter of the *active recall* technique.

Apart from that, my motivation for sharing the knowledge is spreading the Feynman's: *pleasure of finding things out*. I have hopes that you will find doing science fascinating and rewarding.

If you wish to contact me via mail, feel free to drop me a line at: `kamilazdybal@gmail.com`
