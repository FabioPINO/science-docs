# Hello explorer and experimenter, welcome to **Science Docs**!

Or as Python would say:

{% highlight python %}
print("Howdy, Universe!")
{% endhighlight %}

**Science Docs** is a small site with beautiful PDFs that are the product of most of my passion that I have for life, Universe and everything else. I hope that the PDFs will enrich your journey through learning and discovery.
